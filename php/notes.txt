XAMPP
To get a running server:
    - download and install XAMPP
        - you may need to allow access like I had to for MAC
    - after getting the XAMPP application running you'll be in the homepage
    - "Manage Servers" tab will allow you to run Apache, MySQL servers locally

To run php file:
    - make a valid php file with working code
    - in the "Welcom" page of XAMPP, go to "Open Application Folder"
    - go into "htdocs" Folder
    - copy and paste the php file you want to test here
    - go to a browser and put "localhost/<YourPHPFileName.php>
    - check that it is working
